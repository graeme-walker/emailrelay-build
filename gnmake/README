gnmake
======

This is an nmake "clone" (in the loosest sense) that is just good enough to make
perl on Windows -- that's quite a high bar, but there are still plenty of
features missing and botched details compared to the real thing.

Build from the command-line as follows:

* unix

	g++ -o gnmake -pthread -g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -D_DEBUG=1 -DG_UNIX=1 -Isrc/lib -Isrc/main gnmake.cpp

* windows

	cl /nologo /MTd /EHsc /Isrc\lib -Isrc\main /D_DEBUG=1 /c gnmake.cpp
	link /nologo /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /OUT:gnmake.exe gnmake.obj advapi32.lib kernel32.lib

* mingw for 64-bit windows:

	x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++-posix -static -o gnmake.exe -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -DG_WINDOWS=1 -Isrc/lib -Isrc/main gnmake.cpp
