Windows build
-------------
The E-MailRelay 2.5.2 point release has a revised Windows build system so it
is now possible to build using "nmake", without "cmake" or Visual Studio's
"msbuild".

The "libexec/make2cmake" script was previously available for Unix builds, but
it can now be used on Windows either directly or via "winbuild.bat". There is
now a similar script "libexec/make2nmake" to generate "nmake" makefiles, and
this is used by "winbuildall.bat".

Other changes have made it easier to support LibreSSL in Windows builds (see
"winbuildall.bat").

Refer to the developer document for more information.
